**Retail Sales Analysis â€“ SQL Project
Project Overview**
This project focuses on performing an in-depth analysis of retail sales data using SQL. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and generating insights to help understand customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.


**Objective**
To analyze retail transaction data to derive meaningful business insights and support data-driven decision-making.


**Dataset Description**
The dataset used (retail_sales_1) contains the following fields:

Transaction ID, Date, Time, Customer ID, Gender, and Age
Product Category - Quantity, Price per Unit, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), and Total Sale
Tools and Technologies - SQL (PostgreSQL)


**Key Steps Performed**

**1. Data Cleaning:**
    Checked for and removed records with NULL values across key columns to ensure data quality.
    Validated data integrity using count checks before and after cleaning.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis:**
    Counted total transactions and unique customers.
    Identified distinct product categories.
    Analyzed the number of sales over the observed period.

**3. Business Problem Solving:**
    Filtered sales that occurred on a specific date.
    Identified frequent clothing sales during November.
    Calculated total sales and order volume by product category.
    Computed average age of customers in specific categories like Beauty.
    Retrieved all transactions with high-value sales (greater than 1000).
    Analyzed sales distribution by gender across categories.
    Determined average monthly sales and identified the best-performing months.
    Ranked the top 5 customers based on total spending.
    Counted unique customers per category.
    Categorized transactions by time-of-day shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) and analyzed shift-based order volume.


**Insights and Learnings**
Certain product categories significantly outperformed others in both volume and revenue.
A small segment of customers accounted for a large portion of sales.
Time-of-day patterns revealed peak shopping hours.
Month-wise performance helped identify seasonal trends in sales.

**Skills Applied**
Advanced SQL query writing using concepts such as aggregation, filtering, window functions, CTEs, and conditional logic.
Business thinking applied to technical analysis.
Hands-on data cleaning and validation techniques.
